# Coin Market App

A Flutter app that displays real-time cryptocurrency market data, coin details, and allows users to simulate buying and selling of coins. This app uses the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) to fetch cryptocurrency data.

## Features

- **Coin Overview**: View details about a specific coin, including its current price, 24h price change, market cap, high and low prices, circulating supply, and more.
- **Interactive Charts**: Visualize the price trend over different time periods (24H, 7D, 15D, 30D).
- **Buy/Sell Simulation**: Simulate buying and selling of coins with a simple UI.
- **Suggested Coins**: Display a list of other coins that may interest the user.
- **Database Storage**: Use a local SQLite database to store simulated buy/sell transactions.
